userspace:
- support for in-RAM or in-ROM fields in VBEIB

kernelspace:
- finish driver probe and remove functions
- task_prep -> check for failed memory allocations
- check for messages larger than the max connector can handle
- check for missing userspace daemon
- make the daemon configurable
- export device/driver options via sysfs

general:
- printing to tty1 from v86d causes a hang
